It will be easy to find the problem and solutions in future, if we name the files following a naming convention.

Conventions:

1. Publish a readme file along with solution, explaining problem statement or any notes or any important info. Named as  <PROBLEM_NAME>-readme.txt
2. Publish a solution for the problem.  Named as <PROBLEM_NAME>

For example: 

If I am solving a Leetcode problem: I can name it as WordLadder127.java and readme file as WordLadder127_readme.txt

-------------
OR

We simply publish a txt file containing Algo and other important stuff and links.

Happy Learning !! :)
